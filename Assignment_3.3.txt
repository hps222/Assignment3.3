1. Test whether two vectors are exactly equal (element by element). 
vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,])) 
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,])) 

Answer:

Identical(vec1,vec2)

2. Sort the character vector in ascending order and descending order. 

vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,])) 
vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,])) 

Answer:
# In ascending order 
resultvec <- c(vec1,vec2)
sort(resultvec)

# In descending order
resultvec <- c(vec1,vec2)
sort(resultvec,decreasing=TRUE)

3. What is the major difference between str() and paste() show an example. 
Answer:

Compactly display the internal structure of an R object. Its is especially well suited to compactly display the contents of lists. Display one line per basic object.
It describes “What's in this object”.

Difference between str_c() and paste()
=> str_c() uses the empty string “” while paste() uses the white space as the default separator
=> zero length arguments like NULL and character(0) are silently removed by str_c()

4. Introduce a separator when concatenating the strings. 

Answer:
(i) paste(…, sep=””, collapse=NULL)
paste		is the keyword
sep		is a character that would be appended between two adjacent strings and acts as a separator
collapse	is an optional character to separate the results

e.g. paste("Hello", "World", sep = ",")


(ii) cat(..., file = "", sep = " ", fill = FALSE, labels = NULL, append = FALSE)
file		A connection, or a character string naming the file to print to. If "" (the default), cat prints to the standard output connection, the console unless redirected by sink.
sep		a character vector of strings to append after each element.
fill		a logical or (positive) numeric controlling how the output is broken into successive lines. If FALSE (default), only newlines created explicitly by "\n" are printed. Otherwise, the output is broken into lines with print width equal to the option width if fill is TRUE, or the value of fill if this is numeric. Non-positive fill values are ignored, with a warning.
labels		character vector of labels for the lines printed. Ignored if fill is FALSE.
append		logical. Only used if the argument file is the name of file (and not a connection or "|cmd"). If TRUE output will be appended to file; otherwise, it will overwrite the contents of file.

e.g. cat(letters, sep = "-")
